=head1 NAME

Digest::xxHash - xxHash Implementation For Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Digest::xxHash qw[xxhash32 xxhash32_hex xxhash64 xxhash64_hex];

    my $hash = xxhash32( $data, $seed );
    my $hex  = xxhash32_hex( $data, $seed );

    my $hash_64 = xxhash64( $data, $seed );
    my $hex_64  = xxhash64_hex( $data, $seed );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

xxHash is an extremely fast algorithm that claims to work at speeds close to RAM
limits. This is a wrapper of both the 32- and 64-bit hash functions.

=head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE

These functions are easy to use but aren't very flexible.

=head2 $h = xxhash32( $data, $seed )

Calculates a 32 bit hash.

=head2 $h = xxhash32_hex( $data, $seed )

Calculates a 32 bit hash and returns it as a hex string.

=head2 $h = xxhash64( $data, $seed )

Calculates a 64 bit hash.

=head2 $h = xxhash64_hex( $data, $seed )

Calculates a 64 bit hash and returns it as a hex string.

=head1 SPEED

According to the xxhash project's website, when run in a single thread on a
32bit Windows 7 box with a 3GHz Core 2 Duo processor, xxhash looks a little
like:

	SHA1-32         0.28 GB/s    10

Q.Score is a measure of "quality" of the hash function. It depends on
successfully passing
L<SMHasher test set|http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/SMHasher>. 10 is a
perfect score. Hash functions with a Q.score E<lt> 5 are not listed in this
table.

A 64-bits version, named XXH64, is available since (upstream) r35.
It offers much better speed, but for 64-bits applications only.

	Name     Speed on 64 bits    Speed on 32 bits
	XXH64       13.8 GB/s            1.9 GB/s
	XXH32        6.8 GB/s            6.0 GB/s

License-wise, I don't actually care about the wrapper I've written.
